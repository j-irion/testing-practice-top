# testing-practice-top

This project is part of 'The Odin Project'. It solves the given assignments, to help me understand how and why to use tests. The assignments include: A capitalize function, a reverseString function, a calculator object, a cesarCipher function and a function to analyze an array of numbers. I used vanilla JavaScript, npm and Jest for this project.
